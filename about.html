        <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
        <p>During this month at Full Sail University we will be taking our first steps to creating a Website. The request was originally to make a simple HTML page with "Hello World". It drove me nuts how boring it looked so without jumping too far ahead I created this site to build off of in the future. I hope everyone is as excited to see the evolution of this page as I am! </p>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Daniel Schmelzer and after close to 15 years in the restaurant industry mustered the courage to pursue a long time dream. I enrolled at Full Sail University to help me attain the knowledge to become a successful Web Developer. Over the last year we were challenged with learning C# and once we proved ourselves worthy we were were given passage to HTML, CSS and JavaScript where I currently stand in the program. As we progress though the program I will add more and really showcase my creativity. If you have stumbled upon this site and have any suggestions or just want to say "Hi" navigate to the "Contact" section where I list a couple ways to get in touch with me!</p>
